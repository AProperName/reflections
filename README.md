# reflections
My valuable reflections from Udacity's course "How to Use Git and GitHub".

## Usage
You could find the unanswered questions in the above course's marterial. My answers are my reflections of what i learned from the course.
They are **not** the final answer from the instructors or something, thus you should only use them as reference.
## Issue
Should you:
- find anything inaccurate in those answers;
- think you have a better answer for one of the question;
- have a question for me on this repo.

Please create an issue so that i will be notified and work with you on that matter. I appreciate all chances to improve my knowledge on Git and GitHub.
