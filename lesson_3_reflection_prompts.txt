When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When i want to work remotely, work on another machine or share the work with others. In addition, i would want to save my projects somewhere in case something happens to my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because then i will have more control over whether and when i want to pull changes from a remote. Sometimes i'm in the process of making something locally and i wouldn't want to have Git automatically pull other changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    First off, branches are separate parts of the commit history, portrayed as a tree. They have the same origin, or parent commit.
Clones are the processes of making a copy between two repositories, regardless of local or remote ones.
Forks are the processes of making a copy between two remote repositories like ones on GitHub.
It will be much more convenient to use fork when i want to make a direct copy from a repository to mine, with a credit to the source. Fork was created and meant to do that.
Cloning is used when i want to copy from a remote repository to my local one for editing, developing. It also helps me to move/copy between two local repositories.
Branch is of great use when i want to experiment, try making another version of the code without ruining the latest official commit. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a copy of the last known state of the remote will give a a comparision between my current state and that one, in case i forget to push or to check the updates on the remote repository after commiting changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I have to meet up and work together. If not, then i have to work in turn with someone sending me his version of the work, wait for my response and vice versa.
Easier things are that we could keep our work between us, share it when we want to, and don't have to worry about commits, branches, merge and pull requests.
Harder things are that we will have to try hard to merge our work, keep in touch to tell each other about every changes, rollback when we prefer the old version more, and public the work so that we could ask others for help.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
